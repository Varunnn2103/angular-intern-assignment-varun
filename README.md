# Angular Post Management System (Refactored)

This project is a modern Angular application developed for the **Tradexa Angular Intern Assignment**. Originally built with standard directives, it has been refactored to **Angular 19** standards based on technical feedback.

## 🚀 Modern Features Implemented
* **Angular Signals**: Utilizes `signal`, `set`, and `update` for high-performance, fine-grained reactivity.
* **Modern Control Flow**: Migrated from `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` to the new `@if` and `@for` syntax.
* **Loading State Management**: Integrated explicit loader states (`isLoading`) for all asynchronous API calls.
* **Performance Optimization**: Implemented the `track` property in loops to optimize DOM reconciliation.
* **Clean Code Architecture**: 100% removal of inline styles; all styling is handled via a dedicated CSS file to ensure separation of concerns.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Framework**: Angular 19 (Standalone Components)
* **State**: Signals API
* **API**: HttpClient with RxJS
* **Forms**: Reactive Forms with Validation
